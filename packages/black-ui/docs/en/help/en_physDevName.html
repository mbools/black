    Physical Device Name (definition)

    {{#markdown}}
The name of this physical device. You, or your installer, will have assigned this name to the device when
it was created.

You can change the name of any device by clicking on it.

While you may have more than one device with the same name, it is not advisable as this can be confusing. If you
attempt to change a device name to one that already exists you will receive a warning but can confirm that this is
really what you intend to do and the same name will be assigned to multiple devices.
