This page is used to administer all physical devices attached to the system.

Filtering
---------

On larger installations the list of physical devices can become very long and finding the one you are looking for
can be tiresome, so you can filter the list of displayed devices.

Sorting
-------

To help in finding the device you are looking for you can sort the list using the sort icons at the top of the
table columns.

Click once to sort, click a second time to sort in reverse.

Multiple columns can be sorted by sorting the first column as normal, and subsequently ctrl-clicking
sort icons. Each subsequent sort icon will the sort that column as a sub-sort (items are first ordered by
first column and then by the second, and so on.

Multicolumn sorting only makes sense when the first sort results in grouping of the second item. For example,
sorting by manufacturer will naturally group all models associated with that manufacturer, you can then
sort by model and the models will be sorted but only within their manufacturer group.

Adding Physical Devices
-----------------------

In the work panel to the right of the table is the list of physical device types your system supports. Right click
on the type you want to add and select `Add device...`. This will open a device configuration panel where
you can complete the configuration of the device.

Once a device is added it will appear in the device list.
